## ⚠ Disclaimer
##### I created this repository mainly to control my progress. I do not pursue the goal of mass distribution of solutions, so I urge everyone to decide on their own!!!
> * Codewarriors are **strongly encouraged not to look** at your solutions to Kata until they have completed it themselves or at least took the time to think about their own approaches
> * Codewarriors **should  not** submit your solutions as their own
> * You will not be accepting contributions of any form to this repo
> * Creating a repository like this is **discouraged** by Codewars

## Vocabulary
> * **Kata:** is an algorithm you have to solve in any programming language you desire
> * **Kyu:** is a digit that determines kata difficulty level as well as the user rank on the platform
