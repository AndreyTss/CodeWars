    "+ A word is a string of letters (A to Z) optionally containing one or more apostrophes (`'`) in ASCII.\n",
    "+ Apostrophes can appear at the start, middle or end of a word (`'abc`, `abc'`, `'abc'`, `ab'c` are all valid)\n",
    "+ Any other characters (e.g. `#`, `\\`, `/` , `.` ...) are not part of a word and should be treated as whitespace.\n",
    "+ Matches should be case-insensitive, and the words in the result should be lowercased.\n",
    "+ Ties may be broken arbitrarily.\n",
    "+ If a text contains fewer than three unique words, then either the top-2 or top-1 words should be returned, or an empty array if a text contains no words."
